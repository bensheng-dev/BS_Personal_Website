                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Benjamin Sheng. I am a high school senior attending Crescent School in North York, Toronto.

 

                    My dream is to become an aerodynamicist working in Formula One. My idol is Adrian Newey, regarded as the greatest F1 aerodynamicist ever. I look to replicate his success. His autobiography inspired me, detailing everything he's learned over his lengthy career. 
                    
                     
                    
                    This has made me incredibly passionate about engineering, specifically aerospace engineering. I constantly strive to further my understanding of this 
                    
                    complicated field of science. One of my favorite hobbies is analyzing each team's upgrades for a certain weekend. This allows me to stay fresh and continue learning in an ever-evolving sport. 
                    
                    ​
                    
                    Outside of engineering, I love Basketball and have played competitively since grade 3. In addition to Basketball, I enjoy playing volleyball and ultimate frisbee. I run the F1 Fan Forum at my school, which is a club of 60+ fans that get together to watch races, compete in sim races, and play fantasy leagues. As a hobby, I also follow Aviation, MotoGP, and IndyCar.</p>
