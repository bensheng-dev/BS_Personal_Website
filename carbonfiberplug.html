                            <p>When I first got the projecct, I using our old car (Brightside) to make a practice plug. This was to learn 
                                how to use the surfacing tools at hand and create the plug. It took a few weeks to complete the practice plug.
                            The way I achieved this, was by looking at the old car and rolling back CAD features to create the plug. </p>
                            <p>I actually re-created the entire car in CAD before creating the plug. I learned a lot about the process of designing and surfacing
                                airfoils and how to create a clean and accurate plugs. These plugs must be accurate otherwise components designed for the car may not line up as intended.

                            us know where the features of the bottomshell or topshell should be. The fairing indents are 1.5mm and all the lights are 1mm indents. 
                            This will come up as a bump in the fiberglass mold and an indent in the composite layups; which we will then cut a hole out of.

                                process and to get some practice with layups and creating molds. The specifications for the prototype are:

                            with relative ease. The plug while basic did have some challenging aspects. Creating the 1.5mm and 1mm offsets were very difficult. 
                            This is because of the reduced size of the fillets meant that some fillets were creating intersecting geometry when offset. 
                            Unfortunately this issue was only solved by increasing the fillet size. While this in turn did help aero (created less vortices), 
                            it is not a concrete solution to the offset issue.

                            <p>As we develop our new Cascadia car, we are consistently creating new iterations to test in CFD to achieve the lowest possible drag coefficient. 
                                Along the way, our fourth iteration (EP4) had great numbers and was the overall concept that we were going to move forward with. So we used this 
                                iteration to do a lot of testing and to add all the designs of our auxiliaries to the car.

                            <p>One big aspect of building the car is cost. So as a excerise for budget and Solidworks surfacing practice, I created a bottomshell plug of our EP4 aeroshell. 
                                We sent this plug to Dependable Industries to get a quote on a foam male mold. This will help us determine how much money it will cost, and we can make changes to the plug'
                                in an attempt to reduce machining time and cost.

                    <p>As a lead, I am trying to improve our documentation for the next generation of designers will build the car after Cascadia. 
                        I created a master document for surfacing on Cascadia. In this doucment, there are pages of issues that we encountered when surfacing the aeroshell, plugs, canopy and thichkening the aeroshell. 
                        There is also tutorials on how I created the plugs and certain methods that I found very helpful.

                        that improve on the process and quality of the plug.
